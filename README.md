## File2Video

Convert any file to video that consist from QR codes. You can upload it to youtube, and use youtube as unlimited storage. Output video size likely 150 times larger than input file. (If you will upload the video to youtube and download back, file size reduced. Youtube can compress video better)

### Example Usage
First install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run to convert file to video
```
python file2video.py test/test100k.txt out.mp4
```
And you can run to convert back to file
```
python video2file.py out.mp4 .
```
Or give it a youtube url
```
python youtube_video2file.py "https://youtu.be/z7Op3XNvWxw" .
```

### Example output
https://youtu.be/z7Op3XNvWxw

### Notes
If you receive an error like `Could not find encoder for codec id 27: Encoder not found` change the line from file2video.py
```
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'X264')
```
with 
```
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
```

But this time output video size likely 450 times larger then input.
